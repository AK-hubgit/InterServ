Hi there Team Xoon Infotech,

We are thrilled to have you as part of our team and we look forward to your contributions to this project. 

Whether you are joining us today or in the future, we kindly request that you create a new branch for your work to ensure smooth collaboration. By working in your own branch, you can develop and experiment freely without the risk of conflicting with the work of others. 

! When it's time to merge your changes into the main branch, please take care to resolve any conflicts and ensure that the integration is seamless. Your attention to this process is greatly appreciated, and it helps us maintain a clean and efficient codebase. 

Thank you for your cooperation, and happy coding!
